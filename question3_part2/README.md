# Bayesian Intervention Optimizatioon for Causal Discovery

## Overview

This folder contains the implementation of the Bayesian Intervention Optimizatioon for Causal Discovery method as proposed by Wang et al. It leverages the TensorFlow Probability framework for conducting analyses. The folder is structured as follows:
- `demo/`: Contains a demonstration for synthetic experiment in the paper.
- `exps/`: Includes experimental results from replication of the paper.
- `sems/`: Includes various structural equation models.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
- `utils/`: Useful necesssary functions for model construction and data processing.
- `biocd.py`: Implementation of the Bayesian Intervention Optimization for Causal Discovery method.
- `report_biocd.pdf`: Answers to points a to f of Part 2.

## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- TesnorFlow = 2.18.0
