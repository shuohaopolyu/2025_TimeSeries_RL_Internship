    "## Preliminaries for all demonstrations\n",
    "For all demonstrations, we adopt the conventions commonly used in the causal inference literature. An unbolded italic captial letter represents a random variable, simply referred to as a variable. A bolded roman capital letter represents a set of variables. For example, $X$ is a variable, and $\\mathbf{X} = \\{ X_i \\}_{i=1}^n$ is a set of variables. The domain of the variable is denoted by $D(X)$. A lowercase italic letter $x \\in D(X)$ represents a value that is assigned to $X$, and a bolded lowercase letter $\\mathbf{x} = \\{ x_i \\}_{i=1}^n$ represents a set of values that are assigned to $\\mathbf{X}$. The distribution of a variable or a set of variable is denoted by $P(X)$ or $P(\\mathbf{X})$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A causal graph is denoted by $G = \\langle \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{E} \\rangle$. Here, $\\mathbf{V}$ is a set of vertices, each of which represents a variable, and $\\mathbf{E}$ is a set of edges, each of which represents a direct causal relationship between two variables. We also use family notations to represent the set of variables that are parents ($pa(\\cdot)$), children ($ch(\\cdot)$), ancestors ($an(\\cdot)$), and descendants ($de(\\cdot)$) of a given variable, respectively. \n",

    "Structural equation model (SEM) is adpopted to represent the causality in the causal graph. An SCM $M$ is a tuple $\\langle \\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{F}, P(\\mathbf{U}) \\rangle$, where $\\mathbf{U}$ is a set of indepedent exogenous background variables, of which distribution is controled by $P(\\mathbf{U})$, $\\mathbf{V}$ is a set of observed endogenous variables, and $\\mathbf{F}=\\{f_i\\}_{i=1}^{|\\mathbf{V}|}$ is a set of functions represent the relationships among variables, i.e., $v_i = f_i(pa(v_i), \\mathbf{U}_i)$, with $v_i \\in \\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{U}_i \\subseteq \\mathbf{U}$. The causal graph $G$ encodes the causal relationships among variables in $\\mathbf{V}$. Within $\\mathbf{V}$, there are three types of variables: non-manipulative variables $\\mathbf{C}$, which could not be intervened, manipulative variables $\\mathbf{X}$, which could be intervened, and target variables $\\mathbf{Y}$, which are the variables of interest. In all deomonstations, we consider a single target variable $Y$. Probability of $Y=y$ under intervention $do(\\mathbf{x})$ is denoted by $P(y|do(\\mathbf{x}))$, where intervention on $\\mathbf{X}$ is describe by the causal graph $G_{\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}}$ that is obtained by removing all edges pointing to $\\mathbf{X}$."

    "**Question 1:** In the paper, the authors considered very small and simple graphs, which might not be the case in practice. Can you give an example of a causal graph with 15 nodes at each time step -- 7 non-manipulable, 7 manipulable, and 1 target variable, how would you get the exploration set (a key input to the algorithm)? Would you write a program for this purpose?  Is it enough to have simply the causal diagram to get the exploration set?  What additional specifications do you need ?"
