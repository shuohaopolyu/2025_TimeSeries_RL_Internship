Can you give an example of a causal graph with 15 nodes at each time step -- 7 non-manipulable, 7 manipulable, and 1 target variable, how would you get the exploration set (a key input to the algorithm)? Would you write a program for this purpose?  Is it enough to have simply the causal diagram to get the exploration set?  What additional specifications do you need ?"
